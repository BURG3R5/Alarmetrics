# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. And for taking the time to read this
document! All forms of contributions are welcome, including issues, pulls, designs, and
translations. Please read the following guidelines to ensure minimal friction in the process.

### "AI" Policy

Contributions containing significant generated content will not be accepted. The corporations behind
these tools have demonstrated disregard for the environment, the rights of consumers, as well as
real people displaced/affected by their data-centers.

From a more technical point-of-view, this project is not some generic CRUD+API app full of basic
boilerplate. Understanding the codebase and thorough testing is necessary to ensure the project
works in all cases and can be maintained in the future.

Bot-accounts that do not declare themselves as such will be reported and blocked.

## Issues

Bug reports, feature requests and other issues can be created using the relevant templates in the "
Issues" tab on GitHub. If you don't wish to use a GitHub account, you can also contact me via email
at `mail@adityarajput.co`.

## Pulls

If you wish to help out with an existing bug report or feature request, leave a comment on that
issue saying so. If there is no existing issue, open a new one and mention that you would like to
work on it.

Please ensure atomic commits and focused PRs.

## Designs

Design contributions will be treated just like code contributions. Please ensure that your designs
do not infringe on any existing IP, and that you have the necessary rights to use any assets
included in your design.

## Translations

This project's UI is currently only available in English. If you would like to contribute a
translation, please open an issue so we can discuss the workflow.

## Shares

This project was originally created for personal use, and will remain FLOSS and up-to-date as long
as I'm around. There will never be any links asking for monetary contributions. However, as most
brains do, mine likes to see numbers go up, and so if you like the project, please do share it with
people who might find it useful and/or leave a star on GitHub.
